## 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 5.1 HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

#### 5.1.1 System Overview

The HCBS Revenue Management System employs a multi-tier architecture with a clear separation of concerns to support the complex financial workflows required by HCBS providers. The system follows a modular, service-oriented approach with the following key characteristics:

- **Architectural Style**: The system implements a layered architecture with a React-based presentation layer, a business logic layer, and a data access layer. This separation enables independent scaling and maintenance of each layer.

- **Key Architectural Principles**:

  - Separation of concerns for maintainability and testability
  - Stateless services where possible to support horizontal scaling
  - Domain-driven design for the complex financial domain
  - API-first approach for integration flexibility
  - Event-driven architecture for asynchronous processing of financial transactions

- **System Boundaries**:

  - Frontend boundary: Browser-based UI accessible via web browsers
  - Backend boundary: RESTful APIs for internal and external consumption
  - Integration boundary: Secure interfaces with EHR systems, clearinghouses, and accounting systems
  - Data boundary: Encrypted data storage with strict access controls

- **Major Interfaces**:

  - User interface for financial staff and administrators
  - API interfaces for external system integration
  - Batch processing interfaces for claims and payment reconciliation
  - Reporting interfaces for financial analysis

#### 5.1.2 Core Components Table

| Component Name | Primary Responsibility | Key Dependencies | Critical Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User Interface | Provide interactive dashboard, forms, and reports | React, Next.js, Material UI | Accessibility, responsive design, performance |
| Authentication Service | Manage user identity and access | Auth provider, user database | Security, compliance, MFA support |
| Claims Management | Process and track claims lifecycle | Validation service, integration service | Data integrity, state management |
| Billing Service | Convert services to billable claims | EHR integration, validation rules | Compliance with billing standards |
| Payment Processing | Reconcile payments with claims | Payment gateway, accounting integration | Transaction integrity, audit trail |
| Reporting Engine | Generate financial reports and analytics | Data warehouse, visualization library | Performance with large datasets |
| Integration Service | Connect with external systems | API gateways, transformation service | Security, reliability, error handling |
| Data Access Layer | Manage database operations | Database, caching service | Performance, data consistency |

#### 5.1.3 Data Flow Description

The HCBS Revenue Management System processes data through several key flows that support the revenue cycle:

1. **Service to Claim Flow**: Service data enters the system either through manual entry or EHR integration. This data is validated against documentation requirements and authorization limits before being transformed into billable claims. The claims are then validated against payer-specific rules before submission.

2. **Claim Processing Flow**: Submitted claims flow through status tracking as they move from submitted to acknowledged, pending, and finally to paid or denied status. Status updates are received through clearinghouse integrations or manual updates, triggering notifications and dashboard updates.

3. **Payment Reconciliation Flow**: Payment data enters the system through 835 remittance files or manual entry. The system matches payments to claims using intelligent matching algorithms, identifies discrepancies, and updates accounts receivable accordingly.

4. **Reporting Flow**: Financial data from claims, payments, and reconciliation processes flows into the reporting engine, where it is aggregated, analyzed, and presented through dashboards and reports. This data may be further exported to accounting systems.

Key data stores include the transactional database for claims and payments, document storage for supporting documentation, and a reporting data warehouse for analytics. Caching is employed at the API layer and for frequently accessed reports to improve performance.

### 5.3 TECHNICAL DECISIONS

#### 5.3.1 Architecture Style Decisions

| Decision Area | Selected Approach | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overall Architecture | Layered with Service Orientation | Microservices, Monolith | Balance of separation of concerns with development simplicity |
| Frontend Architecture | Server-side Rendering with Next.js | SPA, Traditional MVC | Performance benefits for initial load, SEO capabilities |
| API Design | RESTful with JSON | GraphQL, SOAP | Broad compatibility, simplicity, and developer familiarity |
| Processing Model | Hybrid Sync/Async | Fully Synchronous, Event Sourcing | Balance of immediate feedback with scalable processing |

The layered architecture with service orientation was selected to provide clear separation of concerns while avoiding the operational complexity of a full microservices approach. This approach allows for independent scaling of components while maintaining a cohesive codebase that is easier to develop and maintain.

Server-side rendering with Next.js was chosen for the frontend to optimize initial page load performance, which is critical for financial dashboards with complex data visualization. This approach also provides better SEO capabilities and accessibility compared to pure single-page applications.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Architecture Decision] --> B{Complexity vs Scalability}
    B -->|High Complexity, High Scalability| C[Microservices]
    B -->|Medium Complexity, Medium Scalability| D[Service-Oriented]
    B -->|Low Complexity, Low Scalability| E[Monolith]
    D --> F[Selected Approach]
    A --> G{Development Speed vs Performance}
    G -->|High Performance, Lower Dev Speed| H[Server-side Rendering]
    G -->|Medium Performance, Medium Dev Speed| I[Hybrid Rendering]
    G -->|Lower Performance, Higher Dev Speed| J[Client-side Rendering]
    H --> K[Selected Approach]
```

#### 5.3.2 Data Storage Solution Rationale

| Data Type | Selected Solution | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Transactional Data | PostgreSQL | MySQL, MongoDB | ACID compliance, complex query support, JSON capabilities |
| Document Storage | Amazon S3 | File System, Database BLOBs | Scalability, durability, cost-effectiveness |
| Caching | Redis | Memcached, In-memory | Data structure support, persistence options, pub/sub capabilities |
| Search | Elasticsearch | Database Indexing, Solr | Performance for complex searches, analytics capabilities |

PostgreSQL was selected as the primary database due to its robust support for complex financial transactions, strong data integrity features, and ability to handle both structured data and JSON documents. This flexibility is important for supporting the varied data models required by different HCBS programs and payers.

Document storage on Amazon S3 provides a scalable, cost-effective solution for storing supporting documentation such as service notes and remittance advice files. The separation of document storage from transactional data improves database performance while maintaining secure access to documents.

    A[Data Storage Decision] --> B{Data Characteristics}
    B -->|Transactional, Relational| C[RDBMS Options]
    B -->|Document-oriented, Unstructured| D[Document Storage Options]
    B -->|Temporary, Frequent Access| E[Caching Options]
    C --> F{RDBMS Selection}
    F -->|Complex Queries, ACID, JSON Support| G[PostgreSQL]
    F -->|Simpler Schema, Widespread Use| H[MySQL]
    G --> I[Selected for Transactional Data]
    D --> J{Document Storage Selection}
    J -->|Scalability, Durability, Cost| K[Amazon S3]
    J -->|Simplicity, Local Control| L[File System]
    K --> M[Selected for Document Storage]
```

#### 5.3.3 Caching Strategy Justification

| Cache Type | Implementation | Purpose | Invalidation Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API Response Cache | Redis | Reduce database load for common queries | Time-based + explicit invalidation |
| Session Cache | Redis | Store user session data | Time-based with sliding expiration |
| UI Component Cache | Browser + CDN | Improve UI performance | Version-based cache busting |
| Validation Rules Cache | In-memory + Redis | Speed up claim validation | Event-based on rule changes |

The caching strategy employs multiple layers to optimize performance while ensuring data consistency. API response caching reduces database load for frequently requested data such as reference data and dashboard metrics. Session caching improves authentication performance while maintaining security.

Validation rules caching is particularly important for the claim validation process, which is computationally intensive and requires checking against numerous payer-specific rules. By caching these rules, validation performance is significantly improved without sacrificing accuracy.

### 5.4 CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS

#### 5.4.1 Monitoring and Observability Approach

The HCBS Revenue Management System implements a comprehensive monitoring and observability strategy to ensure system health, performance, and security:

- **Application Performance Monitoring**: New Relic is used to track application performance, including response times, error rates, and resource utilization.

- **Real-time Metrics**: Key business and technical metrics are collected and displayed in operational dashboards, including:

  - Claim processing rates and success/failure metrics
  - Payment reconciliation rates and exceptions
  - API response times and error rates
  - Database performance metrics

- **Health Checks**: All critical services implement health check endpoints that are regularly polled to verify system status.

- **Alerting**: Automated alerts are configured for:

  - Service availability issues
  - Performance degradation beyond thresholds
  - Security events and anomalies
  - Business process failures (e.g., failed batch submissions)

#### 5.4.2 Logging and Tracing Strategy

| Log Type | Content | Storage | Retention |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Application Logs | Errors, warnings, info events | Centralized logging service | 90 days |
| Audit Logs | User actions, data changes | Secure database | 7 years |
| Security Logs | Authentication, authorization events | Secure database | 1 year |
| Integration Logs | External system interactions | Centralized logging service | 180 days |

The system implements distributed tracing using unique correlation IDs that flow through all components of a transaction. This enables end-to-end visibility of complex processes like claim submission and payment reconciliation, making it easier to diagnose issues across component boundaries.

Structured logging is employed throughout the system, with standardized log formats that include:

- Timestamp
- Severity level
- Component/service identifier
- Correlation ID
- User context (when applicable)
- Event description
- Relevant data (sanitized of PHI)

#### 5.4.3 Error Handling Patterns

The system implements a consistent error handling strategy across all components:

- **Validation Errors**: Returned to the user with clear messages and suggested corrections
- **Business Rule Violations**: Logged with context and returned with appropriate guidance
- **Integration Failures**: Handled with retry mechanisms and circuit breakers
- **System Errors**: Logged, reported to monitoring, and presented to users with appropriate abstraction

```mermaid

    F --> P[Return Generic Error to User]
    
    M --> Q[Log Failure]
    M --> R[Notify Administrator]
    M --> S[Implement Fallback if Available]
```

#### 5.4.4 Authentication and Authorization Framework

The HCBS Revenue Management System implements a robust security framework to protect sensitive healthcare financial data:

- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication is supported through integration with Auth0, providing:

  - Username/password authentication
  - SMS or authenticator app second factor
  - SSO options for enterprise customers
  - Password policies compliant with healthcare standards

- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented with the following key roles:

  - Administrator: Full system access
  - Financial Manager: Access to financial reports and dashboards
  - Billing Specialist: Access to claims and billing functions
  - Program Manager: Limited access to program-specific data
  - Read-only User: View-only access to reports and dashboards

- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with:

  - Short session timeouts (15 minutes of inactivity)
  - Secure, HTTP-only cookies
  - Session invalidation on password change
  - Concurrent session limitations

- **API Security**: All APIs are secured with:

  - OAuth 2.0 token-based authentication

## 6.1 CORE SERVICES ARCHITECTURE

### 6.1.1 SERVICE COMPONENTS

The HCBS Revenue Management System employs a modular service-oriented architecture that divides the system into distinct service boundaries while maintaining a cohesive application structure. This approach balances separation of concerns with operational simplicity.

#### Service Boundaries and Responsibilities

| Service | Primary Responsibility | Key Functions | Data Domain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Authentication Service | User identity and access management | Login, token validation, MFA | Users, roles, permissions |
| Claims Service | End-to-end claim lifecycle management | Creation, validation, submission, tracking | Claims, claim history |
| Billing Service | Convert services to billable claims | Service validation, claim generation | Services, billing rules |
| Payment Service | Payment processing and reconciliation | Remittance processing, payment matching | Payments, adjustments |
| Reporting Service | Financial reporting and analytics | Report generation, data aggregation | Reporting data, templates |
| Integration Service | External system communication | Data transformation, protocol handling | Integration logs, mappings |

#### Inter-service Communication Patterns

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Application] --> B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[Authentication Service]
    B --> D[Claims Service]
    B --> E[Billing Service]
    B --> F[Payment Service]
    B --> G[Reporting Service]
    B --> H[Integration Service]
    
    E --> D
    F --> D
    G --> D
    G --> F
    H --> D
    H --> E
    H --> F
    
    I[External Systems] <--> H
```

The system uses a combination of synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns:

| Pattern | Implementation | Use Cases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REST API | HTTP/JSON | User interactions, CRUD operations |
| Message Queue | Redis Pub/Sub | Batch processing, notifications |
| Event Bus | Custom events | Cross-service state updates |
| Webhooks | HTTP callbacks | External system notifications |

#### Service Discovery and Load Balancing

For the initial MVP, the system uses a simplified service discovery approach with DNS-based resolution and a reverse proxy for load balancing:

| Component | Implementation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Service Registry | Configuration-based | Map service names to endpoints |
| Load Balancer | NGINX | Distribute traffic across service instances |
| Health Checks | HTTP endpoints | Verify service availability |

The load balancing strategy employs:

- Round-robin distribution for stateless services
- Session affinity for stateful operations
- Health-based routing to avoid failed instances

#### Circuit Breaker and Resilience Patterns

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Service Call] --> B{Circuit State?}
    B -->|Closed| C[Execute Call]
    B -->|Open| D[Return Fallback]
    B -->|Half-Open| E[Limited Calls]
    
    C --> F{Success?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Record Success]
    F -->|No| H[Record Failure]
    
    G --> I[Keep/Close Circuit]
    H --> J{Failure Threshold?}
    J -->|Exceeded| K[Open Circuit]
    J -->|Not Exceeded| L[Keep Circuit Closed]
    
    E --> M{Success?}
    M -->|Yes| N[Close Circuit]
    M -->|No| O[Open Circuit]
```

The system implements circuit breaker patterns for external integrations:

| Pattern | Implementation | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Circuit Breaker | Resilience4j | 50% failure threshold, 30s reset timeout |
| Retry Mechanism | Exponential backoff | Max 3 retries, starting at 1s |
| Fallback Strategy | Cached data or degraded mode | Service-specific fallbacks |

### 6.1.2 SCALABILITY DESIGN

The HCBS Revenue Management System is designed to scale efficiently to accommodate growing user bases and increasing data volumes.

#### Scaling Approach

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Load Balancer"
        LB[NGINX]
    end
    
    subgraph "Web Tier"
        W1[Web Instance 1]
        W2[Web Instance 2]
        W3[Web Instance N]
    end
    
    subgraph "Service Tier"
        S1[Claims Service 1]
        S2[Claims Service 2]
        S3[Billing Service 1]
        S4[Payment Service 1]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Tier"
        D1[(Primary DB)]
        D2[(Read Replica)]
        C1[(Redis Cache)]
    end
    
    LB --> W1
    LB --> W2
    LB --> W3
    
    W1 --> S1
    W1 --> S3
    W1 --> S4
    W2 --> S1
    W2 --> S2
    W2 --> S3
    W2 --> S4
    W3 --> S2
    W3 --> S3
    W3 --> S4
    
    S1 --> D1
    S1 --> C1
    S2 --> D1
    S2 --> C1
    S3 --> D1
    S3 --> C1
    S4 --> D1
    S4 --> C1
    
    D1 --> D2
```

The system employs a hybrid scaling approach:

| Component | Scaling Method | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web Tier | Horizontal | Stateless design allows easy scaling |
| Service Tier | Horizontal | Services can be independently scaled |
| Database | Vertical + Read Replicas | Maintain data consistency while scaling reads |
| Cache | Horizontal | Distributed caching for performance |

#### Auto-scaling Configuration

| Tier | Scaling Trigger | Scale-Out Rule | Scale-In Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web | CPU Utilization | \>70% for 5 minutes | \<30% for 15 minutes |
| Claims Service | Queue Depth | \>100 items for 2 minutes | \<10 items for 10 minutes |
| Billing Service | CPU Utilization | \>60% for 3 minutes | \<20% for 10 minutes |
| Payment Service | Scheduled | Scale up during remittance processing | Scale down after completion |

#### Resource Allocation Strategy

The system allocates resources based on service criticality and performance requirements:

| Service | CPU Allocation | Memory Allocation | Disk I/O Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claims Service | High | Medium | Medium |
| Billing Service | Medium | High | Low |
| Payment Service | Medium | High | High |
| Reporting Service | Low (burst) | High | Medium |

#### Performance Optimization Techniques

| Technique | Implementation | Target Component |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Caching | Redis for API responses | All services |
| Query Optimization | Indexed views, optimized queries | Database |
| Connection Pooling | Database connection management | All services |
| Asynchronous Processing | Background jobs for intensive tasks | Billing, Reporting |

### 6.1.3 RESILIENCE PATTERNS

The HCBS Revenue Management System implements multiple resilience patterns to ensure high availability and data integrity.

#### Fault Tolerance Mechanisms

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Request] --> B{Primary Available?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Process on Primary]
    B -->|No| D{Failover Configured?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Switch to Backup]
    D -->|No| F{Degraded Mode Available?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Enter Degraded Mode]
    F -->|No| H[Return Error]
    
    E --> I[Process on Backup]
    G --> J[Process with Limited Functionality]
    
    C --> K[Return Response]
    I --> K
    J --> K
    H --> L[Notify Administrator]
```

| Mechanism | Implementation | Recovery Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Service Redundancy | Multiple instances behind load balancer | Seconds |
| Database Failover | Primary-replica configuration | \<1 minute |
| Degraded Mode | Limited functionality during outages | Immediate |
| Request Queuing | Buffer requests during high load | Varies by load |

#### Disaster Recovery Procedures

| Scenario | Recovery Procedure | RTO | RPO |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Service Failure | Auto-restart and health check | 1 minute | 0 |
| Instance Failure | Auto-scaling replacement | 3 minutes | 0 |
| Zone Failure | Cross-zone failover | 5 minutes | \<1 minute |
| Region Failure | Cross-region recovery | 30 minutes | \<15 minutes |

#### Data Redundancy Approach

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Primary Region"
        A[(Primary DB)] --> B[(Read Replica)]
        A --> C[Transaction Logs]
        C --> D[Backup Storage]
    end
    
    subgraph "Secondary Region"
        E[(Standby DB)]
        F[Restored Backups]
    end
    
    C --> E
    D --> F
```

| Data Type | Redundancy Method | Backup Frequency | Retention |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Transactional Data | Synchronous replication | Real-time | N/A |
| Database Backups | Full + incremental | Daily full, hourly incremental | 30 days |
| Document Storage | Cross-region replication | Real-time | N/A |
| Configuration | Version-controlled repository | On change | Indefinite |

#### Service Degradation Policies

The system implements graceful degradation to maintain core functionality during partial outages:

| Service | Critical Functions | Degradable Functions | Fallback Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claims Service | Status tracking | Batch submission | Queue for later processing |
| Billing Service | Validation | Automated generation | Manual mode with templates |
| Payment Service | Basic reconciliation | Automatic matching | Manual matching interface |
| Reporting Service | Basic reports | Custom analytics | Cached reports with staleness indicator |

When degradation occurs, the system:

1. Notifies users of limited functionality
2. Prioritizes critical business functions
3. Queues non-critical operations for later processing
4. Provides manual alternatives where possible

        Claims-->>Billing: Confirm submission
        Billing-->>Gateway: Return result
        Gateway-->>User: Display confirmation
    end
    
    alt Payment Processing Flow
        External->>Integration: Send remittance
        Integration->>Payment: Process remittance
        Payment->>Claims: Match to claims
        Claims-->>Payment: Claim details
        Payment->>Payment: Reconcile
        Payment-->>Gateway: Update dashboard
        Gateway-->>User: Show reconciliation
    end
```

This diagram illustrates the interaction between services during two key workflows: claims submission and payment processing. The architecture enables both synchronous communication for user-facing operations and asynchronous processing for background tasks.

| Concurrent Users | 50-100 | \>80% of capacity for 1 week | Add web instances |
| Database Connections | 200 | \>70% utilization | Increase connection pool |
| Database Size | 100GB | \>70% storage used | Increase storage |
| Cache Hit Ratio | 80% | \<60% for 3 days | Increase cache size |

Capacity planning follows these principles:

1. Monitor key performance indicators continuously
2. Establish baseline performance metrics
3. Project growth based on user adoption rates
4. Plan scaling actions before capacity limits are reached
5. Test scaled configurations in staging environment
6. Implement scaling with minimal user impact

By following these guidelines, the HCBS Revenue Management System can maintain performance and reliability as usage grows, ensuring a consistent user experience throughout the application lifecycle.

| Application | In-memory | Configuration, reference data | On update |
| Distributed | Redis | Query results, session data | TTL + explicit |
| Database | PgCache | Query plans, table statistics | Automatic |
| HTTP | CDN | Static assets, public data | Version-based |

#### Connection Pooling

| Pool Type | Size | Timeout | Monitoring |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Application Pool | 10-50 connections | 30 second wait | Connection usage metrics |
| Read Replica Pool | 5-20 connections | 15 second wait | Pool saturation alerts |
| Reporting Pool | 5-10 connections | 60 second wait | Long-running query alerts |

Connection pool configuration is dynamically adjusted based on:

- Current active user count
- Query complexity and duration
- Server resource utilization
- Peak usage patterns

#### Read/Write Splitting

```mermaid

## 6.3 INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

The HCBS Revenue Management System requires robust integration capabilities to connect with various external systems including EHR/EMR systems, clearinghouses, payer systems, and accounting platforms. This section outlines the integration architecture that enables seamless data exchange while maintaining security, reliability, and performance.

### 6.3.1 API DESIGN

#### Protocol Specifications

| Protocol | Usage | Implementation Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REST | Primary API protocol | JSON payloads, standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) |
| SOAP | Legacy healthcare systems | XML payloads, primarily for clearinghouse integration |
| SFTP | Batch file transfers | Secure file transfer for EDI files (837/835) |
| HL7 FHIR | Healthcare data exchange | REST-based implementation for EHR integration |

The system primarily uses REST APIs with JSON for most integrations, with support for SOAP and SFTP where required by external systems. All APIs follow standard HTTP status codes and include comprehensive error responses.

#### Authentication Methods

| Method | Use Case | Security Features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OAuth 2.0 + OIDC | Primary authentication | JWT tokens, refresh token rotation |
| API Keys | Simple integrations | Key rotation, usage tracking |
| Mutual TLS | High-security integrations | Certificate validation, automatic renewal |
| SAML | Enterprise SSO | Federation with identity providers |

OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect is the primary authentication method for all API integrations, providing secure token-based authentication with proper scoping and expiration.

#### Authorization Framework

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[API Request] --> B[Authentication]
    B --> C[Token Validation]
    C --> D[Scope Verification]
    D --> E[Role-Based Access]
    E --> F[Resource-Level Permissions]
    F --> G[Data-Level Filtering]
    G --> H[API Response]
```

The authorization framework implements multiple layers of security:

| Layer | Implementation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope Verification | OAuth scopes | Limit API access to authorized operations |
| Role-Based Access | Role mappings | Control access based on user/service roles |
| Resource Permissions | ACL system | Fine-grained control over specific resources |
| Data Filtering | Query interceptors | Ensure users only see authorized data |

#### Rate Limiting Strategy

| Limit Type | Default Limit | Customization | Enforcement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Requests per second | 10 RPS | Configurable by client | Token bucket algorithm |
| Concurrent requests | 5 requests | Configurable by endpoint | Connection limiting |
| Daily quota | 10,000 requests | Configurable by subscription | Counter with reset |

Rate limits are enforced at the API gateway level with appropriate headers to indicate limits and remaining quota. Responses include standard `Retry-After` headers when limits are exceeded.

#### Versioning Approach

| Aspect | Strategy | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Version Identifier | URI path versioning | `/api/v1/resource` |
| Compatibility | Backward compatible changes | Add optional fields, preserve existing behavior |
| Breaking Changes | New version required | Maintain previous versions with deprecation notices |
| Deprecation | 12-month timeline | Warning headers, documentation notices |

The system maintains at least one previous API version when introducing breaking changes, with clear deprecation timelines communicated to integration partners.

#### Documentation Standards

| Documentation Type | Format | Delivery Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API Reference | OpenAPI 3.0 | Interactive Swagger UI |
| Integration Guides | Markdown | Developer portal |
| Code Samples | Multiple languages | GitHub repositories |
| Webhooks | Event catalog | Developer portal |

All APIs are documented using OpenAPI 3.0 specifications, with interactive documentation available through Swagger UI. Integration guides include step-by-step instructions and code samples in multiple languages.

### 6.3.2 MESSAGE PROCESSING

#### Event Processing Patterns

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Event Source] --> B[Event Bus]
    B --> C[Event Handler]
    B --> D[Event Logger]
    B --> E[Event Archiver]
    C --> F[Business Logic]
    F --> G[State Change]
    G --> H[New Event]
    H --> B
```

The system implements an event-driven architecture for key business processes:

| Event Type | Examples | Processing Pattern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Domain Events | ClaimSubmitted, PaymentReceived | Publish-subscribe |
| Integration Events | EHRDataReceived, RemittanceImported | Reliable delivery |
| System Events | UserLoggedIn, APIRateLimited | Logging and monitoring |
| Scheduled Events | DailyReportGenerated, WeeklyBilling | Time-triggered |

#### Message Queue Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Producer] --> B[Message Broker]
    B --> C[Consumer Group 1]
    B --> D[Consumer Group 2]
    B --> E[Dead Letter Queue]
    C --> F[Processing Success]
    C --> G[Processing Failure]
    G --> E
    E --> H[Error Handler]
    H --> I[Retry Processor]
    I --> B
    H --> J[Manual Resolution]
```

| Queue Type | Implementation | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Task Queues | Redis | Short-lived processing tasks |
| Durable Queues | RabbitMQ | Critical business operations |
| Dead Letter Queues | RabbitMQ | Failed message handling |
| Priority Queues | RabbitMQ | Time-sensitive operations |

Message queues are used for asynchronous processing of resource-intensive operations such as batch claim submission, remittance processing, and report generation.

#### Stream Processing Design

| Stream Type | Data Flow | Processing Pattern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claim Status Updates | Clearinghouse → System | Real-time processing |
| Payment Notifications | Payment Gateway → System | Event-driven updates |
| Service Documentation | EHR → System | Validation and transformation |
| Audit Events | System → Compliance Storage | Append-only logging |

Stream processing is implemented for continuous data flows that require real-time processing and updates to the system.

#### Batch Processing Flows

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Data Source] --> B[Extract]
    B --> C[Validate]
    C --> D{Valid?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Transform]
    D -->|No| F[Error Handling]
    E --> G[Load]
    G --> H[Reconcile]
    H --> I[Notify]
    F --> J[Error Queue]
    J --> K[Manual Resolution]
    K --> B
```

| Batch Process | Schedule | Volume | Error Handling |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claim Submission | Daily at 6 PM | Up to 1,000 claims | Partial success, retry failed |
| Remittance Processing | Hourly | Up to 500 payments | Item-level validation |
| Eligibility Verification | Weekly | All active clients | Exception reporting |
| Financial Reporting | Daily at 5 AM | All financial data | Degraded reports with warnings |

Batch processes include checkpoints, transaction boundaries, and comprehensive logging to ensure data integrity and recoverability.

#### Error Handling Strategy

| Error Type | Detection | Response | Recovery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Validation Errors | Pre-processing validation | Detailed error messages | Manual correction |
| Integration Failures | Timeouts, error codes | Circuit breaker pattern | Exponential backoff retry |
| Data Inconsistencies | Reconciliation checks | Quarantine invalid data | Manual resolution workflow |
| System Errors | Exception monitoring | Graceful degradation | Automatic retry with limits |

All integration errors are logged with correlation IDs, contextual information, and severity levels to facilitate troubleshooting and resolution.

Dashboards are built using Grafana with role-based access control to ensure users see only relevant information.

### 6.5.2 OBSERVABILITY PATTERNS

#### Health Checks

The system implements multi-level health checks to verify the operational status of all components:

| Health Check Type | Frequency | Verification | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shallow Health | 30 seconds | Service reachability | Auto-restart if failed |
| Deep Health | 2 minutes | Functional verification | Alert if failed |
| Dependency Health | 1 minute | External system connectivity | Alert if failed |
| Database Health | 1 minute | Connection and query execution | Failover if critical |

Health check endpoints follow these patterns:

- `/health/live`: Basic liveness check (is the service running?)
- `/health/ready`: Readiness check (can the service accept traffic?)
- `/health/deep`: Comprehensive health check (are all functions working?)

#### Performance Metrics

Alert routing ensures that notifications reach the appropriate teams based on the nature and severity of the issue. Escalation paths are defined for situations where primary responders are unavailable or unable to resolve the issue.

#### Escalation Procedures

| Escalation Level | Trigger | Responders | Communication Channel |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Level 1 | Initial alert | On-call Engineer | PagerDuty, Slack |
| Level 2 | 30 min without acknowledgment | Team Lead, Secondary On-call | Phone, SMS, Slack |
| Level 3 | 1 hour without resolution | Operations Manager, CTO | Phone, Email, Slack |
| Level 4 | Business impact \> 4 hours | Executive Team | Email, Phone, War Room |

Escalation procedures ensure that critical issues receive appropriate attention and resources. Each escalation level includes specific actions, communication requirements, and decision-making authority.

#### Runbooks

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Incident Detected] --> B[Identify Incident Type]
    B --> C[Access Relevant Runbook]
    C --> D[Follow Diagnostic Steps]
    D --> E{Issue Identified?}
    
    E -->|Yes| F[Apply Resolution Steps]
    E -->|No| G[Escalate to Next Level]
    
    F --> H{Issue Resolved?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Document Resolution]
    H -->|No| G
    
    G --> J[Engage Additional Resources]
    J --> D
    
    I --> K[Update Runbook if Needed]
    I --> L[Close Incident]
```

The system maintains comprehensive runbooks for common incident types:

1. **System Outages**: Steps to diagnose and recover from service failures
2. **Performance Issues**: Procedures for identifying and resolving bottlenecks
3. **Data Integrity Issues**: Methods for detecting and correcting data problems
4. **Integration Failures**: Troubleshooting steps for external system connectivity
5. **Security Incidents**: Response procedures for potential security breaches

Runbooks are stored in a centralized knowledge base and regularly updated based on incident learnings.

#### Post-Mortem Processes

| Post-Mortem Element | Description | Timeline | Participants |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Incident Timeline | Chronological record of events | Within 24 hours | Incident Responders |
